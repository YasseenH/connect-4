# Connect 4

Welcome to the Connect 4 project! This is a Java Swing application that implements the classic game of Connect Four with a graphical user interface.

## Overview

This project aims to recreate the Connect Four game using Java Swing, providing an interactive and visually appealing experience. The game includes features like token placement, winner detection, and game reset functionalities.

## Features

- **Java Swing GUI**: Utilize `JPanel` and `JFrame` to create a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Apply OOP principles to structure the game logic and GUI components effectively.
- **Image Icons**: Use `ImageIcon` to display tokens using `.png` files, enhancing the visual appeal of the game.
- **Pop-Up Messages**: Implement pop-up dialogs to announce the winner and provide an option to reset the game.

## Project Learnings
- Mastered Swing components like `JPanel` and `JFrame`
- Developed skills in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Enhanced GUI design with `ImageIcon` and image handling
- Implemented interactive pop-up messages for game events

## Future Enhancements
- **Token Color Customization**: Allow users to switch token colors based on their preference (e.g., Orange, Yellow, Blue).
- **Enhanced Gameplay Features**: Explore additional game features such as different board sizes, difficulty levels, or multiplayer support.

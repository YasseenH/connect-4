# Connect 4
This is a Java Swing GUI of the game Connect Four.
#
Learned how to:
- Use Swing including JPanel and JFrame
- Implement OOP style programming.
- Use ImageIcon and use .png files
- Use pop-up messages to show winner and to reset game
#
What's Next: 
- Implement switching colors of the tokens based on user input (i.e Orange, Yellow, Blue).
